# fastapi-personal-metadata
Project Title: Personal Metadata Service API

Goal: Develop a robust and highly performant REST API to serve personal professional information, demonstrating strong backend development practices relevant to microservices architecture.

Technology Stack:

Backend: FastAPI (Python) for high performance and automatic data validation (Pydantic).

Data Layer (Planned): PostgreSQL to manage structured data storage, showcasing basic database integration (CRUD operations).

Deployment/Containerization: Docker for streamlined deployment and environment consistency.

Focus/Skills Demonstrated:

API Design: Implementation of clear, maintainable API endpoints.

Data Validation: Using Pydantic models for input and output data validation.

Scalability Foundations: Utilizing an asynchronous framework (FastAPI) which is key for modern cloud-native applications.
